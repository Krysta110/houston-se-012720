# CRUD-AJAX

## Learning Goals
- [x] Create `fetch` requests (including `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`)
- [x] Manipulate the DOM in conjunction with `fetch` calls
- [x] Understand optimistic vs pessimistic rendering
    - Updating UI/DOM

### Deliverables (User Stories)
- [x] As a user, I should see all the Books
- [x] As a user, I should be able to create new Book
- [x] As a user, I should be able to edit a clicked Book
- [x] As a user, I should be able to delete a Book on click of a button

These changes should _persist_ in our database.

**Talk about few things:** Javascript writting style
